Put the 4 Sensel Morphs in place.
NOTE: These pictures don't show it, but you should attach the four right-angle mini USB cables to the four Morphs.

Put Layer4 on.  Note how it overlaps the Morphs, keeping them in place.
NOTE: this picture doesn't show the cables that should already be connected to the Morphs.

Put Layer5 on.  Make sure all the cables are routed so that all the layers lay flat.
<br><img width=400 src="../images/building_controller/IMG_6292.jpg">

Put Layer6 on.
<br><img width=400 src="../images/building_controller/IMG_6293.jpg">
<p>
Note how some of the cables are routed through gaps in Layer5.

Attach two 1-foot USB cables to the monitor, and connect them to one of the USB hubs, as shown.  Also attach the 3-foot HDMI cable to the monitor, as shown.
<br><img width=400 src="../images/building_controller/IMG_6297.jpg">
<p>
<hr><hr>
Attach the four cables from the Morphs to the second USB hub, and route the cables so that all the layers are flat.  You may want to tape the cables down so they don't get in the way when you add the final layer.

This is a picture with everything in place, just before adding the final back layer.

Before you add Layer6, attach the 2 metal L-angle brackets to it, as shown, using short 1/4"-20 bolts.
Note their orientation carefully, in terms of which side the L is on, and which holes the bolts go through.
<p><br>
Then, add Layer6, routing the three cables (two USB cables and one HDMI cable) through its hole.
<p><br>
Finally, screw the bronze caps onto the 5 bolts.  It may be a snug fit.
