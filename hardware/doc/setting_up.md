<h1>Setting up the Space Palette Pro</h1>
You should have these 5 pieces:
<br>1 - core box with all the electronics
<br>2 - oval controller with 4 Morphs
<br>3 - oval monitor
<br>4 - base boxes
<br>5 - plastic bin with misc. parts
<hr>
Here's the core box. Unscrew the thumbscrew, remove the protective panel, and screw the thumbscrew back into the core box.

The core box attaches to the base with 4 bolts (or thumbscrews) in the four corners of the box, which match up with four holes in the top of the base.
On the front side of the core box the holes are visible next to the power supply brick.
On the back side,
you'll need to unscrew the 2 thumbscrews on the back panel in order to fold the back panel down to get access to the two holes in the corners.
Getting these bolts in is the most finicky part of the setup, and small hands are an advantage.

<hr>
Make sure you have these 2 cables (they are either in the plastic bin, or loose in the core box) before you attach the controller to the core box.  These are the 2 cables that will be connected to the monitor.

<hr>
Identify the 3 cables (one HDMI, two USB C) in the core box that are going to connect to the oval controller.
<br><img width=200 src="../images/setting_up/IMG_0893.jpg">
<hr>
Position the oval controller close to the core so that you can connect the 3 cables from the controller to the core.  There are 2 USB C connections - one is colored pink, make sure that one is plugged into the corresponding pink connector.
<hr>
After connecting the 3 cables, place the oval controller on the core box, making sure that the 3 cables are tucked insude the core box, and use thumbscrews (2 on each side) to attach the oval controller to the core box.

Attach the monitor to the back of the core box with 6 thumbscrews.
<br><img width=200 src="../images/setting_up/IMG_0902.jpg">
<hr>
Connect the monitor to the back panel of the core box with 2 cables, one HDMI and one IEC/power.
<br><img width=200 src="../images/setting_up/IMG_0903.jpg">

Slide the headphone hooks onto the matching plastic thing on the back side of the oval controller.

&nbsp;<img width=200 src="../images/setting_up/IMG_0905.jpg">
<hr>
Attach the speakers to the back, using (unscrewing/screwing) the thumbscrews that you've already used for the monitor.
<br><img width=200 src="../images/setting_up/IMG_0906.jpg">
&nbsp;<img width=200 src="../images/setting_up/IMG_0907.jpg">
<hr>
Plug the banana plugs of the speakers into the jacks on the back panel.
<br><img width=200 src="../images/setting_up/IMG_0908.jpg">
<hr>
Plug the headphones into the jacks on the back panel.
<br><img width=200 src="../images/setting_up/IMG_0909.jpg">
<hr>
Plug the female end of a power cord into the male power connection on the back panel.  You may need to use a short extension cable.
<br><img width=200 src="../images/setting_up/IMG_0910.jpg">
<hr>
It should boot up in a few minutes after connecting the power.
<br><img width=200 src="../images/setting_up/IMG_0911.jpg">
<hr>
Normally, you shouldn't need to do anything else, but if there is a problem, you can check on things by sliding out the tiny keyboard and monitor after opening the back panel.  The keyboard has a trackpad on the right side.  You may need to press the blue FN key on the lower left of the keyboard, to wake up the keyboard.  The trackpad should move the mouse, but the cursor may be on the other screens, so you'll have to move it around in order to see it.

This is what the back looks like with everything connected.
<br><img width=200 src="../images/setting_up/IMG_0913.jpg">
<hr>
Put the hourglass panel on the front of the base, it attaches with velcro.
<br><img width=200 src="../images/setting_up/IMG_0914.jpg">
<hr>
If you need to adjust the volume of the speakers, that is done with a single big knob on the speaker amp, accessible inside the back panel.  The headphones have volume controls on their cables for individual control.
