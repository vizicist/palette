Spout 2.004 beta

---------------------------------------------
1) Revision for DirectX setup after installation

The Spout 2.004 installation now includes an additional program "SpoutDirectX.exe" which allows selection of whether DirectX 9 or DirectX 11 functions will be used in Spout applications. The mode selected then applies to all Spout applications that are built with the 2.004 SDK. This means that the developer does not  need to build a project in anticipation of DirectX 9 or DirectX 11 compatibility, the user can select and the application will adapt.

---------------------------------------------
2) Max Jitter externals updated for Max 7 and 64bit

---------------------------------------------
3) "SpoutTray" removed - now redundant

---------------------------------------------
4) C compatible dll for compilers other than Visual Studio, including VS2010 and VS2012 project files and an Openframeworks Codeblocks/ MingW example and project file.

---------------------------------------------
5) Graphics adapter selection for Spout output in SDK
