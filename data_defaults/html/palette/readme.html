<h2>README for Manifold</h2>
<p>
Manifold is a <a href=http://freeframe.org>FreeFrame</a> plugin (FFGL, version 1.5) that can be used
within Resolume 4.0.  (It's possible that it may work in Resolume 3.3 as well.)  It is capable of listening for TUIO over OSC
and generating graphics and music from it.  It was originally designed
for use with the <a href=http://spacepalette.com>Space Palette</a>,
but can also be used with any TUIO-generating application, such as
<a href=http://code.google.com/p/tuiopad/>TuioPad</a>.
<h2>Getting Started</h2>
After installing Manifold, you need to configure Resolume in the following way:
<ol>
<li>
Enable OSC Input on port 7000 (the default)
<p>
<li>
Add the following directory to the list of FreeFrame plugin directories:
<p>
<dd>
<table>
<tr><td>c:\Users\Public\Documents\Nosuch Media\FFGLPlugins</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
</table>
</dd>
</ol>
<h2>Browser-based User Interface</h2>
After you start Resolume, Manifold should appear as a plugin in the Effects section.
When you add Manifold to a composition and run it, you can
interact with it by pointing a browser at
<a href=http://127.0.0.1:4445>http://127.0.0.1:4445</a>.
You can also access this interface remotely by using the
IP address or hostname of the computer, rather than 127.0.0.1 (localhost).
The browser interface only works if Resolume is running and you are running a clip that has Manifold as an effect plugin.
