# Palette - a system for visual music instruments

Palette is used in the <a href=https://youtu.be/HDtxEyCI_zc>Space Palette Pro</a>,
an instrument that lets you fingerpaint sound and visuals
using your fingers as 3D cursors on Sensel Morph pads.  The Palette software consists of:

* A realtime engine that accepts 3D cursors and MIDI as input,
      and generates MIDI (for sounds) and OSC (for visuals in Resolume 7).

* A GUI that lets you control the presets and parameters of
      the musical and graphical output.

* A Freeframe plugin that runs inside Resolume 7.
